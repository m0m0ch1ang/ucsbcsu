            <h2>Big/Little Program!</h2>
            <h3> What is the Big and Little Program?</h3>
            <p> CSU’s Big/Little program is one of many matchmaking systems here at UCSB that allows you to find someone in CSU to be your mentor, mentee, or even just a close friend! By attending a series of events consisting of concepts such as “Speed Dating,” and “Scavenger Hunting” spanning across a few weeks during Fall Quarter/Winter Quarter, you will be able to meet many individuals looking for a big, or a little. Go out there and find your pairing!</p>
            <h4> How do I join the program? </h4>
            
            <p> 1.) Pay the yearly <a href="https://www.venmo.com/u/ucsbcsu">membership fee</a> ($30) </p>
            
            <p>2.) Attend the minimum required amount of events, found on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ucsbcsu/">Instagram Page</a>.</p>

            
            <p> 3.) Interact with others and get yourself out there at the events! We can assure you that there is nothing to be afraid of as we are just excited as you are to partake in this program!</p>
            
            <h5> How many bigs/littles can I have? </h5>
                
            <p> When it comes to bigs, it’s common to have just one big from a single organization! As for littles, you can have as many as you want, but keep in mind that the idea of the program is for you to develop a close bond with whoever you end up being paired with within our community! One non-traditional route that students go is having what is called a “pseudo” big or little, which is an informal way for you to have other “littles” or other “bigs” on top of who is already considered your family. </p>
                
            <h6> What are big/little families? </h6>
                
            <p> Your big and/or little(s) are considered to be in your line. In CSU, we have four big branching families that you can be a part of, depending on where your big lands during the reveal. Each family consists of a collection of big and little lines that will immerse you into an even larger community of individuals within CSU. The four families that you can be apart are Green Dragon Fam, White Tiger Fam, Black Tortoise Fam, and Red Phoenix Fam. </p>
                
            <h7> When will I find out who my big/little is? </h7>
                
            <p> After attending the minimum amount of events required to partake in the big/little program, forms will be sent out where you can put in your thoughts on who you’d want as your big and/or little. After our matchmaking process, we will host a “Reveal” event where the pairings will be announced, followed by a night social which will allow for all of us to come together and celebrate the newly formed friendships! </p>
                
            <h8> Why join a family? </h8>
                
            <p> Though it is not required, many members in CSU currently belong to a family, and have many bigs and littles of their own. It’s a great way to meet new people and connect with individuals that you may find a liking towards through your membership here at CSU. In addition, by being apart of a family, the opportunities are endless as we here at CSU aspire to create an environment where everyone feels included, safe, while also being able to have a great time here at UCSB. </p>
                
                
            <h10> What does the membership allow me to do?</h10>
            
            <p> The membership ($30 per year, or $12 a quarter) allows you entrance into all of our socials, and events where we give back to our members free of charge, whether it be our annual hot pot night, or mini-day socials! CSU aims to provide its members an experience that they can’t get anywhere else, and with these membership fees, you are allowing us the opportunity to provide you guys with this experience! </p>
                
            <p> “GM,” also known as General Meetings, are meetings that we host each quarter that include bonding and icebreaker events, as well as informational speaking pertaining to what is relevant within our organization at the time of the meeting. You do NOT need to be a paid member to attend; come out and see if CSU is the right place for you!</p>
                
            <h11> What are socials? </h11>
                
            <p> Socials are events that we throw (day or night) that allow for community members to get together and have a great time together as we take a mini vacation away from our books, and academics. Paid members get priority access to these socials at free and/or heavily discounted prices. In return for your paid status, we will incorporate certain amenities that will make the fees worth your while! Even if you are not a member, you will still be able to be admitted to a certain social group upon payment. </p>
                
            <h12> Where will these events take place? </h12>
                
            <p> Various locations across campus as well as in Isla Vista are used as “venues” for CSU events. Locations will be sent out prior to the event through Instagram, as well as this website! </p>
                
            <h13> Where does funds collected from fundraising events go towards? </h13>
                
            <p> All money made from fundraising goes directly to all of our events that we will throw for you guys! CSU is not a for-profit organization, and our main goal here as staff is to make sure our community and its members are able to indulge in special events and celebrations throughout the year. </p>
                
            <h14> Have any other questions and concerns? </h14>
                
            <p>Feel free to send us a direct message via e-mail or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ucsbcsu/">Instagram</a> and we will get back to you in a timely manner! If in-person works better for you, take a look at our staff page and feel free to come up to us at any of these events with your question. We will be happy to talk to you!</p>
